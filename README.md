# PvZ-Heroes-Syndrome
Official GitHub page for the goofy "Syndrome" Mod for PvZ Heroes made by PurpleGreen. If you want to make any content out of this mod, be sure to credit my YouTube channel (no matter what platform your content is being uploaded to): http://www.youtube.com/@SussyGren


Everything is done in Notepad++ with the help of UABE.
Keep in mind, I will NOT share how to make such changes to the game and the files. You can look it up on YouTube anyways.


All Patch Notes for each version can be found inside the game's "Help & About" menu. It's been replaced by the Patch Notes.

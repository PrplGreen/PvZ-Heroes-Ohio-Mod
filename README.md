# PvZ-Heroes-Ohio-Mod
Official GitHub page for the goofy "Ohio Mod" for PvZ Heroes
This is a mod made for the game PvZ: Heroes. Everything is done in Notepad++ with the help of UABE.
Keep in mind, I will NOT share how to make such changes to the game and the files. You can look it up on YouTube anyways.
